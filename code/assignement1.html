            <h2>WELCOME</h2>
            <p>Birds have different sizes and can be as small as 2 inches and as big as 2.75 metres. For instance, bee hummingbird (smallest) and ostrich (largest). Birdâ€™s existence dates back to 160 million years ago.
 
              There are different types of birds that exist which vary in characteristics. For instance, there are penguins that cannot fly. Further, there are birds that are known for their intelligence like Parrots and Corvidae.
             
              Moreover, we have peacocks which are beautiful and symbolize rain and good weather. Next, there are bats and vultures as well. Birds connect very closely to the environment and are quite intuitive.
             
              They can predict the weather conditions and some are kept near coal mines for the prediction of a mine explosion. It is because they are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide. They are quite social and enjoy singing as well. Birds enjoy the freedom of moving anywhere without boundaries.
             
              My Favourite Bird
              My favourite bird is the parrot. It is a colourful bird that is present in many parts of the world. It comes in many shapes, sizes and colours. Parrots are famous for having vivid colours.
             
              Some have a single, bright colour while others have a rainbow of different colours.
              Parrots are usually small and medium in size that mostly eats seeds, nuts and fruits.
              The lifespan of a parrot depends on its species.</p>
